.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR [\fIpackage-name-pattern\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "-l, --list [package-name-pattern...]"
List all known packages matching one or more patterns, regardless of their
status, which includes any real or virtual package referenced in any
dependency relationship field (such as \fBBreaks\fR, \fBEnhances\fR, etc.).
If no \fIpackage-name-pattern\fR is given, list all packages in
\&\fI/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/dpkg/status\fR, excluding the ones marked as not-installed (i.e.
those which have been previously purged).
Normal shell wildcard characters are allowed in \fIpackage-name-pattern\fR.
Please note you will probably have to quote \fIpackage-name-pattern\fR to
prevent the shell from performing filename expansion.
For example this will list all package names starting with \(lqlibc6\(rq:

An uppercase status or error letter indicates the package is likely to

Please refer to \fBdpkg\fR\|(1) for information
about the above states and flags.
.Sp
The output format of this option is not configurable, but varies
automatically to fit the terminal width.
It is intended for human readers, and is not easily machine-readable.
See \fB\-W\fR (\fB\-\-show\fR)
and \fB\-\-showformat\fR for a way to configure the output format.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-show\fR [\fIpackage-name-pattern\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "-W, --show [package-name-pattern...]"
Just like the \fB\-\-list\fR option this will list all packages matching
the given patterns.
However the output can be customized using the
\&\fB\-\-showformat\fR option.
.Sp
The default output format gives one line per matching package,
each line consisting of the package name and its installed version,
separated by a tab.
The package name will be architecture qualified for packages with a
\&\fBMulti-Arch\fR field with the value \fBsame\fR or with a foreign architecture,
which is an architecture that is neither the native one nor \fBall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR [\fIpackage-name\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "-s, --status [package-name...]"
Report status of specified packages.
This just displays the entry in
the installed package status database.
If no \fIpackage-name\fR is specified it will display all package entries
in the status database (since dpkg 1.19.1).
When multiple \fIpackage-name\fR entries are listed, the requested status
entries are separated by an empty line, with the same order as specified
on the argument list.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-listfiles\fR \fIpackage-name\fR..." 4
.IX Item "-L, --listfiles package-name..."
List files installed to your system from \fIpackage-name\fR.
When multiple
\&\fIpackage-name\fRs are listed, the requested lists of files are separated
by an empty line, with the same order as specified on the argument list.
.Sp
Each file diversion is printed on its own line after its diverted file,
prefixed with one of the following localized strings:
.Sp

  locally diverted to: \fIdiverted-to\fR
  package diverts others to: \fIdiverted-to\fR
  diverted by \fIpkg\fR to: \fIdiverted-to\fR
.Sp
\&\fBHint\fR: When machine parsing the output, it is customary to set the locale to
\&\fBC.UTF\-8\fR to get reproducible results.
On some systems this might also
require adapting the \fB\s-1LANGUAGE\s0\fR environment variable appropriately if it
is already set (see \fBlocale\fR\|(7)).
.Sp
This command will not list extra files created by maintainer scripts,
nor will it list alternatives.
.IP "\fB\-\-control\-list\fR \fIpackage-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "--control-list package-name"
List control files installed to your system from \fIpackage-name\fR
(since dpkg 1.16.5).
These can be used as input arguments to \fB\-\-control\-show\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-control\-show\fR \fIpackage-name\fR \fIcontrol-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--control-show package-name control-file"
Print the \fIcontrol-file\fR installed to your system from \fIpackage-name\fR
to the standard output (since dpkg 1.16.5).
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-control\-path\fR \fIpackage-name\fR [\fIcontrol-file\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-c, --control-path package-name [control-file]"
List paths for control files installed to your system from \fIpackage-name\fR
(since dpkg 1.15.4).
If \fIcontrol-file\fR is specified then only list the path for that control
file if it is present.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning\fR: this command is deprecated as it gives direct access to the
internal dpkg database, please switch to use \fB\-\-control\-list\fR and
\&\fB\-\-control\-show\fR instead for all cases where those commands might
give the same end result.
Although, as long as there is still at least
one case where this command is needed (i.e. when having to remove a
damaging postrm maintainer script), and while there is no good solution
for that, this command will not get removed.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-search\fR \fIfilename-search-pattern\fR..." 4
.IX Item "-S, --search filename-search-pattern..."
Search for packages that own files corresponding to the given patterns.
Standard shell wildcard characters can be used in the pattern, where
asterisk (\fB*\fR) and question mark (\fB?\fR) will match a slash,
and backslash (\fB\e\fR) will be used as an escape character.
.Sp
If the first character in the \fIfilename-search-pattern\fR is none of
\(oq\fB*[?/\fR\(cq then it will be considered a substring match and will be
implicitly surrounded by \(oq\fB*\fR\(cq (as in
\&\fB*\fR\fIfilename-search-pattern\fR\fB*\fR).
If the subsequent string contains any of \(oq\fB*[?\e\fR\(cq, then it will
handled like a glob pattern, otherwise any trailing \(oq\fB/\fR\(cq or
\(oq\fB/.\fR\(cq will be removed and a literal path lookup will be performed.
.Sp
This command will not list extra files created by maintainer scripts,
nor will it list alternatives.
.Sp
The output format consists of one line per matching pattern, with a list
of packages owning the pathname separated by a comma (U+002C \(oq\fB,\fR\(cq) and
a space (U+0020 \(oq\fB \fR\(cq), followed by a colon (U+003A \(oq\fB:\fR\(cq) and a space,
followed by the pathname.

File diversions are printed with the following localized strings:

  diversion by \fIpkgname\fR to: \fIdiverted-to\fR
.Sp
or for local diversions:
.Sp

  local diversion to: \fIdiverted-to\fR
.Sp
\&\fBHint\fR: When machine parsing the output, it is customary to set the locale to

.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\-avail\fR [\fIpackage-name\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "-p, --print-avail [package-name...]"
Display details about packages, as found in \fI/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/dpkg/available\fR.
If no \fIpackage-name\fR is specified, it will display all package entries
in the \fIavailable\fR database (since dpkg 1.19.1).
When multiple \fIpackage-name\fR are listed, the requested \fIavailable\fR
entries are separated by an empty line, with the same order as specified
on the argument list.
.Sp
Users of APT-based frontends
should use \fBapt show\fR \fIpackage-name\fR instead
as the \fIavailable\fR file is only kept up-to-date when
using \fBdselect\fR.
.IP "\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4

.SH "OPTIONS"

.IP "\fB\-\-admindir=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-\-root=\fR\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "--root=directory"
Set the root directory to \fIdirectory\fR, which sets the administrative
directory to \(Fo\fIdirectory\fR/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/dpkg\(Fc (since dpkg 1.21.0).
.IP "\fB\-\-load\-avail\fR" 4
.IX Item "--load-avail"
Also load the available file when using the \fB\-\-show\fR and \fB\-\-list\fR
commands, which now default to only querying the status file
(since dpkg 1.16.2).
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-pager\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-pager"
Disables the use of any pager when showing information (since dpkg 1.19.2).
.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-showformat=\fR\fIformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --showformat=format"
This option is used to specify the format of the output \fB\-\-show\fR
will produce (short option since dpkg 1.13.1).
The format is a string that will be output for each package listed.
.Sp
In the format string, \(lq\fB\e\fR\(rq introduces escapes:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\en\fR newline" 4
.IX Item "n newline"

\(lq\fB\e\fR\(rq before any other character suppresses any special

Package information can be included by inserting
variable references to package fields using the syntax

printed right-aligned unless the width is negative in which case left

.IX Item "binary:Package"
It contains the binary package name with a possible architecture qualifier
like \(lqlibc6:amd64\(rq (since dpkg 1.16.2).
An architecture qualifier will be present to make the package name unambiguous,
