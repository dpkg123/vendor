.SH "NAME"
dpkg\-trigger \- a package trigger utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBdpkg-trigger\fR
[\fIoption\fR...] \fItrigger-name\fR
.PP
\&\fBdpkg-trigger\fR
[\fIoption\fR...] \fIcommand\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBdpkg-trigger\fR is a tool to explicitly activate triggers and check
for its support on the running \fBdpkg\fR.
.PP
This can be used by maintainer scripts in complex and conditional
situations where the file triggers, or the declarative \fBactivate\fR
triggers control file directive, are insufficiently rich.
It can also
be used for testing and by system administrators (but note that the
triggers won't actually be run by \fBdpkg-trigger\fR).
.PP
Unrecognized trigger name syntaxes are an error for \fBdpkg-trigger\fR.
.PP
This program was introduced in dpkg 1.14.17.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB\-\-check\-supported\fR" 4
.IX Item "--check-supported"
Check if the running \fBdpkg\fR supports triggers (usually called from a
postinst).
Will exit \fB0\fR if a triggers-capable \fBdpkg\fR has run,
or \fB1\fR with an error message to stderr if not.
Normally, however,
it is better just to activate the desired trigger with \fBdpkg-trigger\fR.
.IP "\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-?, --help"
Show the usage message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Show the version and exit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-admindir=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--admindir=dir"
Change the location of the \fBdpkg\fR database.
Defaults to \fI/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/dpkg\fR if \fB\s-1DPKG_ADMINDIR\s0\fR has not been set.
.IP "\fB\-\-root=\fR\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "--root=directory"
Set the root directory to \fIdirectory\fR, which sets the administrative
directory to \(Fo\fIdirectory\fR/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/dpkg\(Fc (since dpkg 1.21.0).
.IP "\fB\-\-by\-package=\fR\fIpackage\fR" 4
.IX Item "--by-package=package"
Override trigger awaiter (normally set by \fBdpkg\fR through the
\&\fB\s-1DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE\s0\fR environment variable of the maintainer scripts,
naming the package to which the script belongs, and this will be used
by default).
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-await\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-await"
This option arranges that the calling package \fIT\fR (if any) need not await
the processing of this trigger; the interested package(s) \fII\fR, will not be
added to \fIT\fR's trigger processing awaited list and \fIT\fR's status is unchanged.
\&\fIT\fR may be considered installed even though \fII\fR may not yet have
processed the trigger.
.IP "\fB\-\-await\fR" 4
.IX Item "--await"
This option does the inverse of \fB\-\-no\-await\fR (since dpkg 1.17.21).
If the interested package has declared a \(lqnoawait\(rq directive, then this
option will not be effective.
It is currently the default behavior.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-act\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-act"
Just test, do not actually change anything.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
.IP "\fB0\fR" 4
.IX Item "0"
The requested action was successfully performed.
Or a check or assertion command returned true.
.IP "\fB1\fR" 4
.IX Item "1"
A check or assertion command returned false.
.IP "\fB2\fR" 4
.IX Item "2"
Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage, or
interactions with the system, such as accesses to the database,
memory allocations, etc.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
.IP "\fB\s-1DPKG_ROOT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DPKG_ROOT"
If set and the \fB\-\-root\fR option has not been specified, it will be used as
the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).
.IP "\fB\s-1DPKG_ADMINDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DPKG_ADMINDIR"
If set and the \fB\-\-admindir\fR option has not been specified, it will
be used as the \fBdpkg\fR data directory.
.IP "\fB\s-1DPKG_DEBUG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DPKG_DEBUG"
Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
The currently accepted flags are described in the \fBdpkg \-\-debug\fR option,
but not all these flags might have an effect on this program.
.IP "\fB\s-1DPKG_COLORS\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DPKG_COLORS"
Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).
The currently accepted values are: \fBauto\fR (default), \fBalways\fR and
\&\fBnever\fR.
