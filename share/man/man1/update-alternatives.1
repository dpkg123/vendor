.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
[\fIoption\fR...] \fIcommand\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
creates, removes, maintains and displays information about the symbolic
links comprising the alternatives system.
.PP
It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or similar
functions to be installed on a single system at the same time.
For example, many systems have several text editors installed at once.
This gives choice to the users of a system, allowing each to use a
different editor, if desired, but makes it difficult for a program
to make a good choice for an editor to invoke if the
user has not specified a particular preference.
.PP
The alternatives system aims to solve this problem.
A generic name in the filesystem is
shared by all files providing interchangeable functionality.
The alternatives system and the system administrator
together determine which actual file is referenced by this generic name.
For example, if the text editors
\&\fBed\fR\|(1)
and
\&\fBnvi\fR\|(1)
are both installed on the system, the alternatives system will cause
the generic name
\&\fI/usr/bin/editor\fR
to refer to
\&\fI/usr/bin/nvi\fR
by default.
The system administrator can override this and cause
it
to refer to
\&\fI/usr/bin/ed\fR
instead,
and the alternatives system will not alter this setting until explicitly
requested to do so.
.PP
The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected alternative.
Instead, it is a symbolic link to a name in the
\&\fIalternatives\fR
\&\fIdirectory\fR,
which in turn is a symbolic link to the actual file referenced.
This is done so that the system administrator's changes can be confined
within the
\&\fI/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc\fR
directory: the \s-1FHS\s0 (q.v.) gives reasons why this is a Good Thing.
.PP
When each package
providing a file with a particular functionality is
installed, changed or removed,
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
is called to update information about that file in the alternatives system.
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
is usually called from the following Debian package maintainer scripts,
\&\fBpostinst\fR
(configure) to install the alternative and from
\&\fBprerm\fR and \fBpostrm\fR
(remove) to remove the alternative.
\&\fBNote\fR: in most (if not all) cases no other maintainer script actions should
call \fBupdate-alternatives\fR, in particular neither of \fBupgrade\fR nor
\&\fBdisappear\fR, as any other such action can lose the manual state of an
alternative, or make the alternative temporarily flip-flop, or completely
switch when several of them have the same priority.
.PP
It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be synchronized,
so that they are changed as a group; for example, when several versions
of the
\&\fBvi\fR\|(1)
editor are installed, the manual page referenced by
\&\fI/usr/share/man/man1/vi.1\fR
should correspond to the executable referenced by
\&\fI/usr/bin/vi\fR.
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
handles this by means of
\&\fImaster\fR
and
\&\fIslave\fR
links; when the master is changed, any associated slaves are changed
too.
A master link and its associated slaves make up a
\&\fIlink\fR
\&\fIgroup\fR.
.PP
Each link group is, at any given time,
in one of two modes: automatic or manual.
When a group is in automatic mode, the alternatives system will
automatically decide, as packages are installed and removed,
whether and how to update the links.
In manual mode, the alternatives system will retain the choice of
the administrator and avoid changing the links (except when something is
broken).
.PP
Link groups are in automatic mode when they are first introduced to
the system.
If the system administrator makes changes to the system's
automatic settings,
this will be noticed the next time
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
is run on the changed link's group,
and the group will automatically be switched to manual mode.
.PP
Each alternative has a
\&\fIpriority\fR
associated with it.
When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives pointed to by members of the group
will be those which have the highest priority.
.PP
When using the
\&\fB\-\-config\fR
option,
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
will list all of the choices for the link group
of which given
\&\fIname\fR
is the master alternative name.
The current choice is marked with a \(oq*\(cq.
You will then be prompted for your choice regarding this link group.
Depending on the choice made, the link group might no longer be in
\&\fIauto\fR
mode.
You will need to use the
\&\fB\-\-auto\fR
option in order to return to the automatic mode (or you can rerun
\&\fB\-\-config\fR
and select the entry marked as automatic).
.PP
If you want to configure non-interactively you can use the
\&\fB\-\-set\fR
option instead (see below).
.PP
Different packages providing the same file need to do so
\&\fBcooperatively\fR.
In other words, the usage of
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
is
\&\fBmandatory\fR
for all involved packages in such case.
It is not possible to
override some file in a package that does not employ the
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
mechanism.
.SH "TERMINOLOGY"
.IX Header "TERMINOLOGY"
Since the activities of
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR
are quite involved, some specific terms will help to explain its
operation.
.IP "generic name (or alternative link)" 4
.IX Item "generic name (or alternative link)"
A name, like
\&\fI/usr/bin/editor\fR,
which refers, via the alternatives system, to one of a number of
files of similar function.
.IP "alternative name" 4
.IX Item "alternative name"
The name of a symbolic link in the alternatives directory.
.IP "alternative (or alternative path)" 4
.IX Item "alternative (or alternative path)"
The name of a specific file in the filesystem, which may be made
accessible via a generic name using the alternatives system.
.IP "alternatives directory" 4
.IX Item "alternatives directory"
A directory, by default
\&\fI/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/alternatives\fR,
containing the symlinks.
.IP "administrative directory" 4
.IX Item "administrative directory"
A directory, by default
\&\fI/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/dpkg/alternatives\fR,
containing
\&\fBupdate-alternatives\fR'
state information.
.IP "link group" 4
.IX Item "link group"
A set of related symlinks, intended to be updated as a group.
.IP "master link" 4
.IX Item "master link"
The alternative link in a link group which determines how the other links in the
group are configured.
.IP "slave link" 4
.IX Item "slave link"
An alternative link in a link group which is controlled by the setting of
the master link.
.IP "automatic mode" 4
.IX Item "automatic mode"
When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives system ensures that the links in the group
point to the highest priority alternative
appropriate for the group.
.IP "manual mode" 4
.IX Item "manual mode"
When a link group is in manual mode,
the alternatives system will not make any changes
to the system administrator's settings.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB\-\-install\fR \fIlink name path priority\fR [\fB\-\-slave\fR \fIlink name path\fR]..." 4
.IX Item "--install link name path priority [--slave link name path]..."
Add a group of alternatives to the system.
\&\fIlink\fR
is the generic name for the master link,
\&\fIname\fR
is the name of its symlink in the alternatives directory, and
\&\fIpath\fR
is the alternative being introduced for the master link.
The arguments after \fB\-\-slave\fR are the generic name, symlink name in the
alternatives directory and the alternative path for a slave link.
Zero or more
\&\fB\-\-slave\fR
options, each followed by three arguments,
may be specified.
Note that the master alternative must exist or the call will fail.
However if a slave alternative doesn't exist, the corresponding
slave alternative link will simply not be installed (a warning will still
be displayed).
If some real file is installed where an alternative link
has to be installed, it is kept unless \fB\-\-force\fR is used.
.Sp
If the alternative name specified exists already
in the alternatives system's records,
the information supplied will be added as a new
set of alternatives for the group.
Otherwise, a new group, set to automatic mode,
will be added with this information.
If the group is in automatic mode,
and the newly added alternatives' priority is higher than
any other installed alternatives for this group,
the symlinks will be updated to point to the newly added alternatives.
.IP "\fB\-\-set\fR \fIname\fR \fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--set name path"
Set the program
\&\fIpath\fR
as alternative for
\&\fIname\fR.
This is equivalent to
\&\fB\-\-config\fR
but is non-interactive and thus scriptable.
.IP "\fB\-\-remove\fR \fIname\fR \fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--remove name path"
Remove an alternative and all of its associated slave links.
\&\fIname\fR
is a name in the alternatives directory, and
\&\fIpath\fR
is an absolute filename to which
\&\fIname\fR
could be linked.
If
\&\fIname\fR
is indeed linked to
\&\fIpath\fR,
\&\fIname\fR
will be updated to point to another appropriate alternative
(and the group is put back in automatic mode), or
removed if there is no such alternative left.
Associated slave links will be updated or removed, correspondingly.
If the link is not currently pointing to
\&\fIpath\fR,
no links are changed;
only the information about the alternative is removed.
.IP "\fB\-\-remove\-all\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--remove-all name"
Remove all alternatives and all of their associated slave links.
\&\fIname\fR
is a name in the alternatives directory.
.IP "\fB\-\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "--all"
Call \fB\-\-config\fR on all alternatives.
It can be usefully combined with
\&\fB\-\-skip\-auto\fR to review and configure all alternatives which are
not configured in automatic mode.
Broken alternatives are also displayed.
Thus a simple way to fix all broken alternatives is to call
\&\fByes '' | update-alternatives \-\-force \-\-all\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-auto\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auto name"
Switch the link group behind the alternative for
\&\fIname\fR
to automatic mode.
In the process, the master symlink and its slaves are updated
to point to the highest priority installed alternatives.
.IP "\fB\-\-display\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--display name"
Display information about the link group.
Information displayed includes the group's mode
(auto or manual),
the master and slave links,
which alternative the master link currently points to,
what other alternatives are available
(and their corresponding slave alternatives),
and the highest priority alternative currently installed.
.IP "\fB\-\-get\-selections\fR" 4
.IX Item "--get-selections"
List all master alternative names (those controlling a link group)
and their status (since version 1.15.0).
Each line contains up to 3 fields (separated by
one or more spaces).
The first field is the alternative name, the second
one is the status (either \fBauto\fR or \fBmanual\fR), and the last one contains
the current choice in the alternative (beware: it's a filename and thus
might contain spaces).
.IP "\fB\-\-set\-selections\fR" 4
.IX Item "--set-selections"
Read configuration of alternatives on standard input in the format
generated by \fB\-\-get\-selections\fR and reconfigure
them accordingly (since version 1.15.0).
.IP "\fB\-\-query\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--query name"
Display information about the link group
like \fB\-\-display\fR does, but in a machine parseable way
(since version 1.15.0, see section \*(L"\s-1QUERY FORMAT\*(R"\s0 below).
.IP "\fB\-\-list\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--list name"
Display all targets of the link group.
.IP "\fB\-\-config\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--config name"
Show available alternatives for a link group and allow the user to
interactively select which one to use.
The link group is updated.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Show the usage message and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Show the version and exit.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.IX Item "--instdir directory"
Specifies the installation directory where alternatives links will be created
(since version 1.20.1).
Defaults to \(Fo\fI/\fR\(Fc if \fB\s-1DPKG_ROOT\s0\fR has not been set.
.IP "\fB\-\-root\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "--root directory"
Specifies the root directory (since version 1.20.1).
This also sets the alternatives, installation and administrative
directories to match.
Defaults to \(Fo\fI/\fR\(Fc if \fB\s-1DPKG_ROOT\s0\fR has not been set.
.IP "\fB\-\-log\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--log file"
Specifies the log file (since version 1.15.0), when this is to be different
from the default (/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/log/alternatives.log).

.IP "\fBSlaves:\fR \fIlist-of-slaves\fR" 4
.IX Item "Slaves: list-of-slaves"
When this field is present, the \fBnext\fR lines hold all slave links
associated to the master link of the alternative.
There is one slave per line.
Each line contains one space, the generic name of the slave
alternative, another space, and the path to the slave link.
.IP "\fBStatus:\fR \fIstatus\fR" 4
