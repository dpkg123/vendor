.SH "NAME"
apt-transport-http \- APT transport for downloading via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This APT transport allows the use of repositories accessed via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\&. It is available by default and probably the most used of all transports\&. Note that a transport is never called directly by a user but used by APT tools based on user configuration\&.
.PP
HTTP is an unencrypted transport protocol meaning that the whole communication with the remote server (or proxy) can be observed by a sufficiently capable attacker commonly referred to as a "man in the middle" (MITM)\&. However, such an attacker can
\fInot\fR
modify the communication to compromise the security of your system, as APT\*(Aqs data security model is independent of the chosen transport method\&. This is explained in detail in
\fBapt-secure\fR(8)\&. An overview of available transport methods is given in
\fBsources.list\fR(5)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Various options can be set in an
\fBapt.conf\fR(5)
file to modify its behavior, ranging from proxy configuration to workarounds for specific server limitations\&.
.SS "Proxy Configuration"
.PP
The environment variable
\fBhttp_proxy\fR
is supported for system wide configuration\&. Proxies specific to APT can be configured via the option
Acquire::http::Proxy\&. Proxies which should be used only for certain hosts can be specified via
Acquire::http::Proxy::\fIhost\fR\&. Even more fine\-grained control can be achieved via proxy autodetection, detailed further below\&. All these options use the URI format
\fIscheme\fR://[[\fIuser\fR][:\fIpass\fR]@]\fIhost\fR[:\fIport\fR]/\&. Supported URI schemes are
socks5h
(SOCKS5 with remote DNS resolution),
http
and
https\&. Authentication details can be supplied via
\fBapt_auth.conf\fR(5)
instead of including it in the URI directly\&.
.PP
The various APT configuration options support the special value
DIRECT
meaning that no proxy should be used\&. The environment variable
\fBno_proxy\fR
is also supported for the same purpose\&.
.PP
Furthermore, there are three settings provided for cache control with HTTP/1\&.1 compliant proxy caches:
Acquire::http::No\-Cache
tells the proxy not to use its cached response under any circumstances\&.
Acquire::http::Max\-Age
sets the allowed maximum age (in seconds) of an index file in the cache of the proxy\&.
Acquire::http::No\-Store
specifies that the proxy should not store the requested archive files in its cache, which can be used to prevent the proxy from polluting its cache with (big) \&.deb files\&.
.SS "Automatic Proxy Configuration"
.PP
Acquire::http::Proxy\-Auto\-Detect
can be used to specify an external command to discover the HTTP proxy to use\&. The first and only parameter is a URI denoting the host to be contacted, to allow for host\-specific configuration\&. APT expects the command to output the proxy on stdout as a single line in the previously specified URI format or the word
DIRECT
if no proxy should be used\&. No output indicates that the generic proxy settings should be used\&.
.PP
Note that auto\-detection will not be used for a host if a host\-specific proxy configuration is already set via
Acquire::http::Proxy::\fIhost\fR\&.
.PP
See the
\fBsquid-deb-proxy-client\fR(1)
and
\fBauto-apt-proxy\fR(1)
packages for example implementations\&.
.PP
This option takes precedence over the legacy option name
Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect\&.
.SS "Connection Configuration"
.PP
The option
Acquire::http::Timeout
sets the timeout timer used by the method; this value applies to the connection as well as the data timeout\&.
.PP
The used bandwidth can be limited with
Acquire::http::Dl\-Limit
which accepts integer values in kilobytes per second\&. The default value is 0 which deactivates the limit and tries to use all available bandwidth\&. Note that this option implicitly disables downloading from multiple servers at the same time\&.
.PP
The setting
Acquire::http::Pipeline\-Depth
can be used to enable HTTP pipelining (RFC 2616 section 8\&.1\&.2\&.2) which can be beneficial e\&.g\&. on high\-latency connections\&. It specifies how many requests are sent in a pipeline\&. APT tries to detect and work around misbehaving webservers and proxies at runtime, but if you know that yours does not conform to the HTTP/1\&.1 specification, pipelining can be disabled by setting the value to 0\&. It is enabled by default with the value 10\&.
.PP
Acquire::http::AllowRedirect
controls whether APT will follow redirects, which is enabled by default\&.
.PP
Acquire::http::User\-Agent
can be used to set a different User\-Agent for the http download method as some proxies allow access for clients only if the client uses a known identifier\&.
.PP
Acquire::http::SendAccept
is enabled by default and sends an
Accept: text/*
header field to the server for requests without file extensions to prevent the server from attempting content negotiation\&.
